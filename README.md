# Welcome to the project

In this project we will be using github, canvas and p5.js for making a space shooter game
Trello will be used for assigning tasks to pairs and pull requests will be used to add the new features as everyone develops them.

# Prerequisites
An http server running on your PC to see the website in localhost instead of opening file in Chrome

###  If you have Atom get this plugin
https://atom.io/packages/atom-live-server

#### If you have npm run this command to get an alternative tool
`npm http-server -g`

Now run the server in the directory where you have the project and now you can browse the website just like it would be on codepen

All files you will need to use for coding are in js folder, using functions from libraries and built-in from javascript are greatly encouraged.

Try to make code friendly and stylish so the mentors can understand easily
